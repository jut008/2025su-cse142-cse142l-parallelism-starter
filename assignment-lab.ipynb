    "\n",
    "The notebook will only run one cell at a time, so if you press `shift-return` several times, the cells will wait for one another.  You can tell that a cell is waiting if it there's a `*` in the `[]` to the left the cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll can also tell _where_ the notebook is executing by looking at the table of contents on the left.  The section with the currently-executing cell will be red:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Do Jupyter Notebook It Gets Stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check if it's actually stuck: Some of the cells take a while, but they will usually provide some visual sign of progress.  If _nothing_ is happening for more than 10 seconds, it's probably stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get it unstuck, you stop execution of the current cell with the \"interrupt button\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also restart the underlying python instance (i.e., the confusingly-named \"kernel\" which is not the same thing as the operating system kernel) with the restart button:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you do this, all the variables defined by earlier cells are gone, so you may get some errors.  You may need to re-run the cells in the current section to get things to work again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also try reloading the web page.  That will leave Python kernel intact, but it can help with some problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Errors and Non-Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you get something like `failed: no such file or directory`, please make sure you executed all cells before the current one.\n",
    "2.  Sometimes `cse142 run` will just sit there and seemingly do nothing.  Weirdly, interrupting the kernel (button above) and restart the kernel seems to jolt it awake and cause it to continue.\n",
    "3. If you get errors similar to `NameError: name 'render_csv' is not defined` or something similar, please re-execute the very beginning cell of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Embedded Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code embedded in the assignment falls into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Code you need to edit and understand.\n",
    "2.  Code that you do not need to edit or understand -- it's just there to display something for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "For code in the first category, the assignment will make it clear that you need to study, modify, and/or run the code.  If we don't explicitly ask you to do something, you don't need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code in the second category is for drawing graphs.  You can just run it with shift-return to the see the results.  If you are curious, it's mostly written with `Pandas` and `matplotlib`. The code is all in `notebook.py`.   These cells should be un-editable.  However, if you want to experiment with them, you can copy _the contents_ of the cell into a new cell and do whatever you want (If you copy the cell, the copy will also be uneditable).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Cells are Immutable** Many of the cells of this notebook are uneditable. The only ones you should edit are some of the code cells and the text cells with questions in them.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answering Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this document, you'll see some questions (like the one below).  You can double click on them to edit them and fill in your answer.  Try not to mess up the formatting (so it's easy for us to grade), but at least make sure your answer shows up clearly.  When you are done editing, you can `shift-return` to make it pretty again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips, pointers, and caveats for answering questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The answers are all in [github-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with some html sprinkled in.  Leave the html alone.\n",
    "2. Many answers require you to fill in a table, and many of the `|` characters will be missing.  You'll need to add them back.\n",
    "3. The HTML needs to start at the beginning of a line.  If there are spaces before a tag, it won't render properly.  If you accidentally add white space at the beginning of a line with an html tag on it, you'll need to fix it.\n",
    "4. Text answers also need to start at the beginning of a line, otherwise they will be rendered as code.\n",
    "5. Press `shift-return` or `option-return` to render the cell and make sure it looks good.\n",
    "6. There needs to be a blank line between html tags and markdown.  Otherwise, the markdown formatting will not appear correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there are three kinds of questions: \"Correctness\", \"Completeness\", and \"Optional\".  You need to provide an answer to the \"Completeness\" questions, but you won't be graded on its correctness.  You'll need to answer \"Correctness\" questions correctly to get credit.  The \"Optional\" questions are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSE142\n",
    "If you are taking CSE142, you will need to submit the CSE142&CSE142L questions before each CSE142 assignment deadline. These questions will be graded based on correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSE142L\n",
    "Your grade for this lab report will be based on your completion and submission of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Check Gradescope for the due dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for submitting the assignment/lab are at the end of the assignment/lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "No late work or extensions will be allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Alder Lake is an x86 processor, you're strongly encourage to review x86 assembly before starting the rest of the assignment. You may find [this link](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) useful "

    "# Thread-level parallelism in modern processors\n",
    "\n",
    "ILP and MLP exist within a single core, and the degree of parallelism is limited by the number of instructions the CPU can issue per cycle. To get more parallelism, we need to use more CPUs, and for that we'll need to create threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is a flow of control through your program that runs on a processor. Every program has at least one thread, and by creating multiple threads you can spread the work of your program across many cores, hopefully improving it's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making programs fast via multi-threading is an extremely deep and complex area. We could easily spend an entire quarter studying techniques for creating, managing, and using threads, and most universities (including UCSD) offer several courses on this topic (Start with Operating Systems and then take the graduate Parallel Computation course). Indeed, some people have devoted their entire careers to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this effort is for good reason: the amount of ILP and MLP that individual cores can utilize has been roughly constant over last decade and shows no signs of improving much. Making matters worse, clock speeds are growing very slowly. That means that adding cores is the main way that computer are getting faster, but that only works if we can use threads effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, it's week 8, and we don't have time for all of that. Instead, we are going to take a whirlwind tour of how you can create threads, how to make them communicate with one another, why the underlying hardware can make that hard and/or slow, and what you can do about it.\n",

This matches expectations since with 1 thread we measured 342,656,038 instructions and multiplying by 4 gives about 1,370,624,152. The small difference comes from overhead like creating and joining threads. The CPI stays consistent across runs from 0.804833 to 0.836418 and execution time only changes slightly from 0.110339 seconds with 1 thread to 0.120502 seconds with 4 threads, showing that each thread did the same amount of work and the instruction count scales as expected.\n",

    "In order for threads to work together, they must share variables:  _Sharing_ means that more than one thread is reading and/or writing to the variable during the same period of time.  Threads working together _must_ share some information, otherwise they cannot make progress together on a common goal.  For example, imagine expecting 8 people in sealed rooms, who have never met, to make progress on a single task -- it is not possible.\n",

    "The code below declares a global variable, initializes it to zero, and then provides `wait()` to wait for it to change.  It also provides `signal()` to update the global variable.  You could imagine that two threads could use these two function to coordinate in a simple way:  Thread `T1` could call `wait()` to wait for another thread, `T2`, to do something.  When `T2` is done, it could call `signal()` to let `T1` know it has done it.\n"

    "As written and compiled with optimizations, the compiler does what we would expect:  it checks `flag` once. If it's non-zero (i.e., it evaluates to `true`), it returns.  Otherwise it loops infinitely.  This will clearly not work as a thread communication mechanism:  Unless `T2` calls `signal()` _before_ `T1` calls `wait()`, `T1` will never get the message.\n",

    "\n",

    "Answer: Yes, the std::cerr line can execute. flag and other_value are volatile but not atomic, so there is no happens-before relationship between the threads. A writer does other_value = my_id then flag = my_id. The reader spins until flag == other_id, then immediately loads flag and other_value. On a weakly ordered CPU, the reader can observe the newer flag but a stale other_value, so t_flag != t_other_value becomes true and the mismatch prints. volatile only stops some compiler optimizations on the single thread. It does not give inter-thread synchronization, ordering, or atomicity. The correct fix is to use std::atomic&lt;int&gt; with release on the writes to other_value and flag and acquire on the reads in wait, or use a mutex or condition variable.\n",

    "Hmmm... That is definitely not \"never\" executing, although it is pretty rare.  It's also non-deterministic:  If you run it more than once, you'll get different mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's going on?  It would seem that our intuitive understanding of how our multi-threaded program should execute does not match what actually happens when it really executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This source of this mismatch is something called the processor's _consistency model_.   The consistency model determines how processors \"see\" memory operations performed by other processors.  In particular, it  determines in what order stores _appear_ to occur.  Different instruction sets come with different consistency models: x86 has one, ARM has one, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency models are easily the most complicated aspect of modern Instruction Set Architectures, and their details are pretty far beyond the scope of this course. However, they are crucial for making multithreaded programs work, so we will cover a few basic points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic problem with the code above is that the x86 consistency model allows the stores that `T0` performs to _appear_ , from `T1`'s perspective, to happen in a different order than `T0` executed them in.  In the code above, `T1` can load from `flag` and find that it's equal to 0 _and then_ read from `other_value` and find it equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "x86 provides some special instructions that prevent this reordering.  They are called 'fences' because they keep memory operations from moving around.  It's possible to use them directly, but that's a subject for another class.  Instead, we'll use _locks_, which are a cleaner way of coordinating threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Locks\n",
    "\n",
    "A _lock_ or _mutual exclusion variable (mutex)_ is a small data structure that can be _locked_ and _unlocked_.  We'll use C++'s `std::mutex`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a thread calls `lock()` on a mutex that is not currently locked, the thread \"holds\" the lock and starts executing a region of code called a \"critical section\".  At the end of the critical section, it calls `unlock()` to release the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a thread, `T`, calls `lock()` on a mutex that _is_ currently locked, it will wait until the thread that holds it calls `unlock()`.  Then, `T` gets the lock and can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that, at any time, only one thread is executing inside the critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, locks are implementing using some kind of flag (similar to `flag` in our example above) and some of those fences I mentioned above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example.  In this code, we have a shared variable `shared`.  Several threads are going to work together to increment `shared` 600,000 times.  If we run with $n$ threads, each will do 600,000/$n$ increments.\n",
    "\n",

    "This is a read-modify-write that is not atomic. With multiple threads, two cores can both load the same old value of shared from their caches, both add 1, and then each store back, so one increment is lost. This is the classic data race and lost-update problem. Cache coherence does not fix it because coherence preserves visibility of writes, not the atomicity of the whole read-modify-write. Reorderings via store buffers can also let one thread observe stale values while another’s write is still pending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding std::mutex turns the increment into a critical section protected by lock.lock() and lock.unlock(). The mutex operations are implemented with atomic instructions and memory fences that provide acquire–release semantics and a happens-before relationship. Only one thread can execute the load–add–store at a time, so no two threads can read the same old value, and every increment counts, yielding the correct final shared value. Also note that volatile int shared does not provide atomicity or ordering between threads; it only restricts compiler optimizations within one thread.\n",

    "There are two main things to take away from this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Just taking and releasing locks is expensive -- even if there's only one thread.  This overhead comes mostly from increased instruction count.  In addition, fences are expensive: could take hundreds of cycles on our machine.\n",
    "2.  When there is more than one thread competing for the lock, things get even worse.  This overhead comes from increase cache misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are noteworthy.  The extra instructions in the locks are an example of the overhead involved in improving performance.  We saw this before with loop tiling:  Splitting and renesting loops can improve performance but it also increases instruction count, so some of the improved performance goes to paying for that overhead.  It the same thing here:  Taking and releasing a lock is code we didn't have to run before and that doesn't contribute to the useful work our program is doing.  There is no free lunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cache misses are a bigger problem and, interestingly, they are due to kind of cache miss we have not seen before in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cache Coherence and the 4th C\n",
    "\n",
    "In assignment 2 we've seen the Capacity, Conflict, and Compulsory misses, but there is a 4th kind of miss that only occurs in multi-processing systems:  Coherence Misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned in CSE142, cache coherence is how the processor keeps multiple caches synchronized, so that the processors all see the same value for a given address.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory, the key point of coherence are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Coherence operates on cache lines, like all things in the memory hierarchy.\n",
    "2.  Multiple processors can have a copy of the a cache line in their cache if they are _only_ reading from it.\n",
    "3.  Only a single processor may have a copy of the cache line if it is writing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing #2 and #3 is expensive:  When a processor wants to update a cache line, it has to tell all the processors that have a copy of it to _invalidate_ their copy.  This means removing it from the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a memory access would have been a hit, but it is a miss because the cache was invalidated, we call that a _coherence miss_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfying cache misses is multiprocessors is also more complicated due to coherence:  If a load misses in the cache it has to check the other caches to see if they have a copy.  If they do, then that copy is more up-to-date than what is in main memory, so that is where the cache line needs to be loaded from.  This is called a _cache-to-cache_ transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The invalidations and cache-to-cache transfers are implemented by sending message between the caches over an on-chip network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sending messages across such a network can be pretty expensive and take quite a long time.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coherence Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple program to measure the cost of communicating between cores.  We are going to run two threads either on the same core or on two different cores.  The only trick is that we control which thread runs where.  You can look at `threads.hpp` to see how `bind_to_core()` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind:  When the two threads are running on the same core, they will have to take turns, so that single core will be doing twice as much work than each core in the two-core case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in an ideal world, the two-core case would be twice as fast as the one-core case.\n"

    "### Non-Uniform Memory Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple processors complicates the notion of memory latency as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely at the on-chip network above, you can notice that there are two memory controllers -- one on each of the side of the on-chip network.  This mean that, depending on where a core is in relation to the DRAM it's trying to access, the memory latency will be different.  Similarly, depending on which part of the L3 cache a cache line landed, the latency of an L2 cache might vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effect is called non-uniform memory access (NUMA).  NUMA effects are even greater if a computer has multiple sockets -- some memory requests will have to go between chips while others are \"local\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It'd be great to measure NUMA effects on our machine, but our machine only has 6 cores, 1 socket, and one (active) memory controller, so there's not enough non-uniformity to measure reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply what we have learned so far to implement a fast histogram.  A histogram counts the number of occurrences of data values in a sample of data.  In our case, we are going to count how often each of the 256 possible 1-byte values appears in an array of 64-bit values.  So our histogram will have 256 \"buckets\".  Our task is to compute the histogram as fast as possible.\n",

    "Answer: No, the serial histogram would not benefit from tiling. The working set that is repeatedly reused is the histogram itself, and it is tiny. With 256 buckets and 8-byte counters the array is about 2 KB, which easily fits in a 32 KB L1 data cache. Once the histogram lines are brought into L1 they are reused throughout the whole scan, so there is no capacity pressure to relieve with tiles. The data array is streamed exactly once, so its misses are mostly compulsory; tiling cannot reduce those either. The measurements back this up: the L1 miss rate is already very low (≈0.64%), and the compiler has fully unrolled the inner loop to keep the hot counters live and minimize control overhead. Adding tiling here would just add extra loop control and bookkeeping without improving locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiling could help only in different regimes, for example if the histogram had many more buckets so it no longer fit in L1, or in a parallel version where you give each thread a private histogram and combine at the end.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each increment takes a global mutex. The critical section is tiny but executed for every byte of every element, so all threads serialize on the same lock. That creates heavy contention and lock convoying, adds large instruction overhead from lock and unlock, and causes coherence traffic as the cache line holding the lock and hot histogram buckets ping-pong between cores. You can see the effects in the counters: ET balloons to 6.07s and CPI rises to 3.07, with the L1 miss rate increasing to 0.0367. A better design is to avoid the shared lock by using per-thread private histograms and combining at the end.\n",

    "One problem is that we only have one lock even though we have 256 different buckets.  This means that each thread has to lock _all_ the buckets for each increment.  That's a lot of overhead and a lot of contention.  Let's fix by making our locks more \"fine grained\":  Each of them will cover just one bucket.\n",

    "Answer: The performance drop from 1 to 2 threads is caused by false sharing in the private-bucket array. In the current layout, for a given bucket value all threads update adjacent memory locations, which end up on the same cache line. This causes the cache line to constantly ping-pong between cores, leading to a huge increase in L1 misses and CPI when more than one thread is active. The fix is to reorganize the array so that each thread’s set of 256 counters is in a separate region of memory, aligned and padded so they do not share cache lines. With this change, threads update disjoint memory locations and avoid false sharing, allowing performance to scale as intended when moving from 1 to multiple threads.\n",

    "Finally!  That's speedup! We've got almost 2x speedup with 8 threads!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Amdahl's Law and Imperfect Speedup\n",
    "\n",
    "In our histogram example, we finally got some speedup with threads.  Speeding up a program by $p$ with $p$ processors is called _linear speedup_ and it's always the goal of multi-threaded.  It's hard to achieve, however, because of Amdahl's Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, in this class we've talked about Amdahl's Law as it applies optimizations:  The more widely applicable an optimization, the larger it's benefit.  Originally, however, Amdahl's Law was just about parallel computation.  In particular, if we have $p$ processors, Amdahl's Law bounds the maximum speedup, $S$, we can achieve:\n",
    "$$S \\leq \\frac{1}{x/p + (1-x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ is the fraction of the program that can parallelized across all $p$ processors.  For the histogram example, $x = 1$, so $S \\leq p$, and our implementation achieved this upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, however, $x < 1$, so $S < p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, let's parallelize merge sort.  The implementation below divides the array in half and recursively calls merge sort on each sub array.  To parallelize it, we will spawn a thread to sort each sub-array.  As the sub arrays get smaller and smaller, two things will happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We will spawn an enormous number of threads.\n",
    "2.  Each of them will do very little work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither of these is good, so we'll use `threshold` to control the minimum size for which we will spawn a thread.  If the sub-array is smaller than `threshold`, we'll just do all the work in the current thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if the array is of size `threshold` $ \\times 2^k$, we'll use a maximum of $2^k$ threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there are no locks.  This is because there's not actually any sharing:  Only one thread is ever working on any one part of the array at a time.  (The attentive reader will recall that I said that sharing is necessary to coordinate threads.  Here, the sharing and coordination happen before the threads are created and after we `join()` them). "

    "$$ Serial\\ Fraction = \\frac{1}{\\log_{2} 4096} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.083 $$\n",

    "It's pretty tricky to calculate $x$ precisely, but we can do it big-O style.  The key observation is that merge sort in $O(n \\lg n)$ and the final merge operation is completely serialized.  That final merge takes $O(n)$ comparisons and assignments, so it takes $$\\frac{n}{n\\log n}$$ of the the total execution time.\n",

    "Note that  we did the blocking ourselves this time.  OpenMP breaks the execution of the outer loop into tiles, but the local set of histogram counters, `my_histogram`, is local _to the loop iteration_ it is in.  If we didn't tile the outer loop ourselves, the lock in the `omp critical` would get taken/released on _every iteration_.  By tiling the loop ourselves, we collect a bunch of updates in `my_histogram` and then apply them all at once.   In this case, the tiling doesn't provide a locality benefit (because `data` is never reused), but it does reduce locking overhead!  \n",

    "OpenMP also support SIMD parallelism, which uses vector instructions to improve performance.  We discussed SIMD during the 142L lecture last week.  Review the podcast, if you missed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying SIMD with OpenMP is pretty easy:  You just put `#pragma omp simd` before the loop body.  The loop needs to very regular (e.g., constant stride and no branches), and there's no guarantee that the compiler will be able to vectorize it.  Indeed, `omp simd` doesn't speedup our histogram code, so we'll look at a simpler example.\n",
